    "Natural Language Processing is a very versatile tool in data science.  Among other things, it can be used to quantitate the affect, or emotional content, of text.  This technique is called sentiment analysis, and is often used in industry to measure how customers feel about a particular company or product.  It can also be used to determine how other countries or populations feel about U.S. policy.\n",

    "Sputnik is a Russian state-run media outlet, however its affiliation with the Russian state is obfuscated.  English language versions of Sputnik articles regarding U.S. policy were shared frequently during the Russian disinformation campaign that occurred around the 2016 election. In this exercise, you will measure the sentiment of a Sputnik article that mentions a U.S. political candidates.  By the end of this exercise, you should have an idea how the Russian government \"feels\" about these candidates."
